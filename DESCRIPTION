Title: Random Number Generation from R and C
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: c(person("Rich", "FitzJohn", role = c("aut", "cre"),
                    email = "rich.fitzjohn@gmail.com"),

Description: Provides an R and C interface to the 'PCG' (Permuted
    Congruential Generator) family of random number generators. These
    can be used from R code but the primary aim is to make it possible
    to access these generators from C or C++ code using R's
    'LinkingTo' support.
